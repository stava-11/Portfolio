# Overview

This is an app written in Kotlin using Android Studio. It is the beginning of an app that allows you to use intents to take a picture with the phone's camera
and then send the image to a contact. The image is currently not being able to be sent to a contact.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to build the app and used the emulator that is provided by Android Studio. It is written in Kotlin. There are no special libraries that I
used to build this app.
