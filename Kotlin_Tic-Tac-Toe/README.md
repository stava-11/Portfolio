# Overview

This is an app written in Kotlin using Android Studio. It is a version of Tic-Tac-Toe to play on android phones. You open the app and play the game with 
someone sitting next to you. It keeps track of turns, doesn't let you change input and tells you who the winner is if there is one.
I created this app to learn how to build an app in Kotlin.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to build the app and used the emulator that is provided by Android Studio. It is written in Kotlin. There are no special libraries that I
used to build this app.
