# Cloud Database

The database that was planned to be used for this is a NoSQL database with Google Firestore.

# Development Environment

This is written in PHP and develop in Visual Studio Code. Composer was needed for this develoment project as well. If version one of Composer is what you currently have, then you will need to update this to a newer version. PHP does not have a lot of documentation or resources to use when it comes to Firestore.
